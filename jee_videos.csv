movement: where things are, where they're going, and how quickly they're gonna get there. But there's something missing -- something
that has a lot to do with Harry Styles. And today, we're gonna address that. We've been talking about what happens when
you do things like throw balls up in the air or drive a car down a straight road. That kind of motion is pretty simple, because
there's only one axis involved."

On5DpeGQ89I,Two Dimensional Motion Problems - Physics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On5DpeGQ89I,4771,341668,89,12.5,240130.69999999998,in this video we're going to work on a two-dimensional motion problem with multiple parts so let's go ahead and begin A ball rolls horizontally off a 500 meter Cliff at a speed of 5 meters per second well let's begin with a picture so let's say this is the cliff and here is the ball and it's going to roll off the cliff and then it's going to hit the ground how long will it take for the ball to hit the ground now what I like to do is I like to Define the positions of Interest we'll call this position a which is the initial position and position B or the final position now we know the height of the cliff it's 500 meters and we know the ball has a horizontal speed of 5 meters per second let's write that better so with this information how can we find the time it's going to take from for the ball to go from position a to position B how long will it take for it to hit the ground now hopefully you have a list of physics equations with you if not I recommend that you go to YouTube and in the search bar type in kinematics organic chemistry tutor I have a video entitled kinematics which will give you a list of formulas that you need to solve two-dimensional motion problems even one dimensional motion problems as well also check out my video projectile motion that's going to be more of the two-dimensional motion problems and it's going to have even more formulas for you for you to use when solving uh these types of problems but the equation that we could use is this one since we're dealing with vertical motion y final is equal to Y initial Plus v y initial t plus one half a t squared now there's a lot of variables in this formula our goal is to calculate t now what is y initial and Y final if we assume this to be ground level that means position B is at a y value of zero so that's going to be y final B is the final position a is the initial position y initial well that's going to be the height of a cliff that's at 500 meters so we have that now what about v y initial now the ball initially is moving horizontally it only has an X component it doesn't have a y component so for any object moving in horizontal in a horizontal Direction the vertical velocity is going to be zero so that's v y initial at Point a now the vertical acceleration for any object in free fall it's always going to be negative 9.8 because that object is under the influence of gravity so any object on Earth under free fall it's going to have that vertical acceleration by the way you should check out my other video If you go to YouTube and type in free fall physics organic chemistry tutor I have another video that talks about how to solve problems with objects in free fall including objects like this one so feel free to check out those three videos free fall physics kinematics and projectile motion for those of you who want more problems so now let's finish this problem why filo is zero y initial is 500 v y initial is zero and then it's plus one half the acceleration is negative 9.8 and we need to solve for t so moving to 500 to the other side we're going to get Negative 500 one-half times negative 9.8 that's going to be negative 4.9 so now what we need to do is divide both sides by negative 4.9 these will cancel and we'll get t squared is equal to negative 500 divided by negative 4.9 that's going to be 102.04 taking the square root of that number this will give us 10.1 so let's put that here it's going to take 10.1 seconds for the ball to go from position a to position B so that's the answer for the first part of the problem now let's move on to Part B how far from the base of the cliff will the ball land in other words what is the range of this projectile a projectile is simply an object under the influence of gravity in fact gravity is the only force acting on a projectile so a rocket would be considered a projectile because it's affected by the thrust of the engine but any object that's moving in air only under the influence of gravity by definition is a projectile so how can we calculate the range of this projectile the range is simply the horizontal distance or you could say horizontal displacement in this problem they're the same since the object doesn't change direction so the range is going to be DX and if you want to find the displacement it's equal to the velocity multiplied by the time so if we want to find a horizontal displacement it's a v x times t now for a projectile the horizontal velocity is constant the vertical velocity changes with time because the object has a vertical acceleration but if you want to just find the range it's simply equal to VX times T in this example VX is 5 meters per second and we know the object is going to be moving for 10.1 seconds based on the answer that we got in part a so 5 times 10.1 that gives us a range of 50 .5 meters that's the answer for Part B now what about part C what is the final speed of the ball just before it hits the ground now at this point we need to realize that the ball doesn't just have an X component its velocity has a y component as well the X component is going to remain constant it's not going to change because the acceleration in the X direction is zero however the vertical velocity of the Y component will change because there is an acceleration in the y direction to find the New Vertical Velocity at point B it's going to be equal to the initial Vertical Velocity plus a t so this is the formula V final is equal to V initial plus a t just in the y direction v y initial is zero the acceleration in the y direction is negative 9.8 and the time that this object is going to be in Flight is 10.1 seconds negative 9.8 times 10.1 and that gives us a vertical velocity of negative 98.98 meters per second so right now the ball at point B just before it hits the ground has a horizontal velocity of 5 meters per second and it has a vertical velocity of negative 98.98 meters per second so this is VX and this is v y our goal is to find the final speed so we need to get V using the Pythagorean theorem V is going to be the square root of VX squared plus v y squared a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared if you want to calculate C the hypotenuse is equal to the square root of a squared plus b squared so v x is five and v y is negative 98.98 so go ahead and plug that in so V is 99.1 meters per second this is the answer to part C and that is the final speed speed is always positive velocity can be positive or negative now Part D is asking for the final velocity of the ball just before it hits the ground whereas part C is asking for the final speed we have the final speed but to get the final velocity we need the direction remember velocity is speed with Direction we have the magnitude which is the speed but we need to get the direction in other words we need to get the angle so let's calculate the angle Theta the angle inside of that acute triangle is going to be the reference angle and to find it we're going to take arctan of v y over VX now we're only going to use the absolute values of v y and VX we don't need to worry about the negative sign right now so it's 98.98 over 5. this gives us a reference angle of 87.1 degrees but I'm going to get the angle measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis that's going to be 360 minus the reference angle so 360 minus 87.1 will give us an angle of 272.9 degrees which tells us that the vector the velocity Vector is in quadrant four it's moving in that direction so part C the speed the final speed just before hits the ground is simply 99.1 meters per second part D the final velocity is the combination of these two answers the final velocity of the ball just before histogram is 99.1 meters per second at an angle of 272.9 degrees counterclockwise from the positive x-axis so that's basically it for this video so now you know how to solve a typical two-dimensional motion problem so if you want more problems like this check out my videos on projectile motion kinematics
